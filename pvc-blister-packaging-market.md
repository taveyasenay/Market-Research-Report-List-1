<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PVC Blister Packaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoforming</li><li>Cold Forming</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PVC blister packaging is primarily categorized into two types: thermoforming and cold forming. Thermoforming involves heating PVC sheets until pliable, then molding them into specific shapes to create blisters that securely hold products. This method is cost-effective and versatile for various applications. Cold forming, on the other hand, utilizes a much thicker material that is shaped under pressure without heat, creating a more robust barrier against moisture and light. This type is often preferred for pharmaceutical applications due to its superior protective qualities.</p></p>
