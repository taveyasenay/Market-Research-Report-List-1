<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-ablative Lasers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Ablative Fractionated Lasers</li><li>Non-Ablative Non-Fractionated Lasers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-ablative laser market is divided into two main types: non-ablative fractionated lasers and non-ablative non-fractionated lasers. Non-ablative fractionated lasers deliver laser energy in a grid-like pattern, promoting collagen production while leaving surrounding tissue unaffected, enhancing skin texture and tone. In contrast, non-ablative non-fractionated lasers provide uniform energy across the skin, focusing on skin tightening and pigmentation issues without damaging the surface layer. Both modalities are popular for their efficacy in rejuvenation with minimal downtime.</p></p>
