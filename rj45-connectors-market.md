<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RJ45 Connectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shielded</li><li>Unshielded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The RJ45 connector market is segmented into two main types: shielded and unshielded. Shielded RJ45 connectors are designed to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk, making them ideal for environments with high electrical noise, such as industrial settings. Unshielded connectors, on the other hand, lack this protective layer and are more commonly used in residential and office networks where electromagnetic interference is minimal. Each type serves specific networking needs, influencing choice based on environment and performance requirements.</p></p>
