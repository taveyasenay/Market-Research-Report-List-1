<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safety Syringes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Retractable</li><li>Non Retractable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The safety syringes market is primarily divided into two types: retractable and non-retractable syringes. Retractable syringes feature a mechanism that allows the needle to be safely retracted into the barrel after use, minimizing the risk of needle-stick injuries. Non-retractable syringes, on the other hand, have fixed needles that do not retract, often relying on design features to reduce exposure and enhance safety. Both types are crucial in healthcare settings to protect patients and healthcare workers from potential infections and injuries.</p></p>
